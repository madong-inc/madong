## Open Source Multi-Tenant SaaS Rapid Development Framework
We are committed to breaking the illusion of pseudo-open source, striving to build an exemplary open-source SaaS multi-tenant cloud platform architecture that combines excellence, simplicity, and beauty. Upholding the principle of "taking from open source and giving back to open source," we aim to free developers' valuable time, allowing them to enjoy every moment of life—whether it's leisurely relaxing, immersing in self-improvement, cherishing time with family, or pursuing fitness; or even encountering soulmates and painting beautiful life scenarios together.

## Technical Features
✅ Elegant Layout System: Simple interface + multiple themes + navigation mode, freely combinable as desired  
✅ Enterprise-Level Function Stack: Out-of-the-box SaaS/multi-tenant/RBAC permission system  
✅ Intelligent Message Push: Distributed messaging system based on WebSocket + Redis  
✅ Efficient Traffic Control: Comprehensive traffic control and blacklist mechanism  
✅ Modular Design: Core project + optional plugins, easily removable components  

## Performance
