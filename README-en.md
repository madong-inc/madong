In the PHP ecosystem, while there are many excellent backend management systems, few meet personal requirements while leveraging socket frameworks. We've developed a powerful backend management system that supports diverse scenarios including website administration, CMS, CRM, OA, and ERP systems.

## Technical Architecture
**Backend:** Built on the Webman framework with enterprise-grade layered architecture. This design efficiently serves startups and individuals with minimal server resources while achieving performance comparable to static languages.

**Frontend:** Uses Vue3 + Vite6 + Pinia + Ant Design Vue 4. This modern stack enables seamless adaptation across PC, mobile, and tablet devices, ensuring consistent user experience.
